Name: Kate Strombom

1) The size for a newly created list begins at 1, when it should begin at 0
2) The addBack doesn't work when adding to a non-empty list; it will add the
value of the first node over and over again
3) removeFront acts like removeBack
4) isEmpty doesn't work, presumably because the size is incorrect. Because
isEmpty is dependent on size, and size is a private variable, there is no way to
see what exactly is occuring in isEmpty.
